### What is Higehr order function?

A function which takes another function as an argument or returns a function is known as Higher Order Function

e.g.

```
function x(){
    console.log("This is Amaan")
}

function y(x){
    x();
}

// Here function y is the higher order function which takes function x as an argument

// SO we can say that x is the callback function
```
